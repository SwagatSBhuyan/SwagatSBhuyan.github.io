								<p>
									My name is Swagat Shubham Bhuyan and Iâ€™m currently an Application Engineer (IC2) at Oracle. <br>
									Computers have always peaked my excitement, and from a very young age I decided to dedicate my education and contributions to the field of Computer Science.  <br>

										<h2>Research Interests</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										Having a life-long affinity towards video games, I want to contribute to this field through software engineering roles, Game Development projects or AI algorithms. I have worked in a Natural Language Processing 
										publication, hence I have an interest in this field. With new research on NLP used in NPC interactions for video games, I want to contribute to NLP usage in video game technology. I have also worked in Computer Vision
										and game development projects and technologies in the past, hence Computer Vision is also one of my research interests. I have also worked on Computer graphics technologies such as Blender and OpenGL, which would also
										suit me to pursue research in the field of Computer Graphics as well.

										<h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										I have developed a palette for a lot of hobbies through my college years. Exposed to a cultural melting pot in NIT Silchar, I have developed affinity for literature and art, machine learning, video games, sports and music.
										<br>
										Music is an obvious interest for probably most people, and that includes me. I have been into classical music from a young age, because of which I was enrolled into tabla and guitar classes. I have completed my certifications
										on Tabla and am currently a Visharad Tabla Player. Along with that, I have some interest in singing as well, but no vocal training to my name.
										<br>
										Being an avid Video Game enthusiast from my early days playing Age of Empires II, I have consumed a plethora of video game experiences. From then on, I have dabbled into all genres of video games, be it turn based strategy games
										like the Civilization franchise to RPG action games like the Witcher franchise. I find myself relating more to the story-telling mechanics that a video game provides compared to other forms of media. From the world building and immersion-focused
										video games like the Assassin's Creed and Farcry franchise to the fast paced FPS titles like Valorant and CSGO, I have delved deep into these narratives and enjoy them thoroughly.
										<br>
										"All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy" - that's what my mom used to say if I was bogged down by school work and stuck at home. This inspried me to take up interest in Sports such as Football (Soccer), Badminton, Cycling, Cricket,
										etc. I also started playing chess at State-level from the young age of 10, and have brought laurels to my school and family.
										<br>
										Engaging in cultural discussions with my friends in college exposed me to a lot more hobbies such as Movies, Series, Quiz and trivia. I actively took part in many such quizzing events and have won prizes as well. As time went by,
										I started contributing to the Quiz club by hosting quizzes. I started the Konami Code, a blend of two of my favourite things - Quiz and Video Games. It is a Video Gaming Trivia event, that is still held annually in my college - NIT Silchar
										by the Quiz club.

										<h2>Volunteering</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										Born and raised in a small township in Assam, India, my family was relatively well off because our locality was financially lacking compared to the rest of India. Acknowledging our privilege, our family cherished the
										idea of charity. Hence, volunteering and charity are a big part of my moral compass. I joined the Computer Science Society as a Technical Member, where I helped host C++ classes for junior batches.  I was also an active
										member of Illuminits until graduation, where I engaged in multiple volunteering drives, participated in and organized numerous cultural events, and hosted various quiz competitions under its Quiz Club wing.
										<br>
										Working at Oracle has helped me rekindle my passion for volunteering, as Oracle has a vibrant volunteering environment. I am currently an Oracle Volunteer working in collaboration with Team Everest NGO in their program,
										Readiness Skills for Girls. Here, I am assigned a a college student as a mentee, with I have one-on-one sessions with over the phone where I train her to become ready for the job market in her respective field, and also
										help her find the best career path that would suit her skills and interests. This volunteering event entails a total of 39 sessions with the mentee, where 3 modules are covered - "Know a Career", "Getting Job Ready" and
										"Critical and Logical Thinking".
